Things that always need to be done (◔_◔):
1) Set up more complex items to Tinkers.
2) Create a guide to register materials in the github wiki.
3) Clean up the unneccessary comments (dead code).
4) Add more comments to explain how the code works and its tinkers construct counterpart.

Temperary TODO Tasks:
5) Add Armor invis and item in hand invis
6) Add a trait that has the target say something in chat
7) Make InventorySatchel more dynamic like Inventory<T> where T is an instance of ItemTotemSatchel
8) Make it so that the Totems keep thier custom data like names when being moved into the totem bag.
9) Maybe remove shareTagCompound from itemTotemSacthel
10) add trait schafold, auto eat, freecam?, double jump, Anti Overlay {Removes various overlays from your screen like pumpkin on your head}, 
auto armor, breadcrumbs {Creates a trail behind you}, click tp {Teleport to the block you're looking at}, jump boost, 
HeatlhReveal {Shows how much health the other player has}, antiKnockback, Pot {automatically throws potions from your inventory}, 
aimbot for bows, spider {can climb walls}, Step {allows you to step up a full block}, and weather controller {only turn rain off, not on}

***Some of the traits in 10) are overpowered and may need to be nerfed some how.
